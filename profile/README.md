## The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) GitHub Organization

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **LIFE** (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets) concept. 

You can find more information about the mission on the [website](https://life-space-mission.com/).

You can find all the currently LIFE-related published papers on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=%22LIFE%22+%22large+interferometer%22&terms-0-field=abstract&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first).

# Statement of Expectations for the LIFE GitHub Organization

The LIFE GitHub Organization serves as a central hub for software developments related to the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanets) Initiative. This organization aims to provide user-friendly access to the main codes developed within the LIFE Initiative, including noise simulators, retrieval tools, catalogs, and codes used to generate plots for published papers. Our goal is to create a showcase for users interested in utilizing these tools, which might otherwise be challenging to locate.

## Expectations:
- **Repository Maintenance**: The codes hosted within this organization are not maintained by the organization itself. Each repository is maintained by its original developers or designated maintainers. Users should direct any questions or issues to the specific repository owners or contributors.

- **Code Quality and Peer Review**: While we strive for high-quality code, it's important to note that the organization does not have a formal code review process beyond what may have occurred during the peer-review of associated publications. Code quality remains the responsibility of individual developers and the community.

- **Support and Assistance**: Users should not expect to receive support for misuse or general help from the organization. For questions or issues, please contact the individual developers of each repository directly.

- **Data Storage**: Large datasets associated with these projects are not stored on GitHub. Instead, they are hosted on Zenodo, with links provided in the relevant repository README files.

- **Repository Ownership and Collaboration**: Developers retain control over their repositories even when hosted under the LIFE organization. They can continue to access, modify, and develop their code as before. The organization structure provides additional benefits:

- **Continuity**: In case of changes in the development team, transition of repository management is streamlined, as the code doesn't reside in private accounts.

- **Community Engagement**: The organization framework facilitates community input and collaborative efforts through pull requests and forks, making it easier for the wider scientific community to contribute to and improve the codebase.

- **Visibility**: Hosting repositories within the organization increases their visibility and discoverability, potentially attracting more users and contributors.

- **Code Misuse**: The organization is not responsible for monitoring or preventing potential misuse of the hosted code. Users are expected to use the provided tools responsibly and in accordance with any specified licenses or usage terms.

- **Project Inclusion**: Projects that are specifically related to LIFE mission objectives may be included in this organization. General-purpose tools or personal projects may remain in individual repositories outside the organization.

By providing access to these tools and codes, we aim to foster collaboration, increase visibility of LIFE-related research, and facilitate the work of researchers in the field of exoplanet science. However, users should be aware that the organization serves primarily as a hosting platform and does not imply ongoing support, maintenance, or vetting beyond what individual repository owners provide.

We encourage users to review the documentation and README files in each repository for specific usage instructions, contribution guidelines, and any additional expectations set by the repository owners.
